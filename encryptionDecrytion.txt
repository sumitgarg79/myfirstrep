 cacerts in java ( c:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_11\lib\security\cacerts )  is used to add SSL certificates 
cacerts' is a truststore. A trust store is used to authenticate peers. A keystore is used to authenticate yourself.

public key can be decripted using private key 
private key can be generated by openSSL on linux , once private key is generated , use private key to create public key 
data is encrypted using public key and using private key it is decrypted
puttygen is used to generate public private keys on windows ( openssl is used on linux)

step 1 :- generate keypair ( private/public) 
The Java Keytool is a command line tool which can generate public key / private key pairs and store them in a Java KeyStore
step 2:- generate certificate using key pair 

step3 :- import export certificate into keystore

PEM Format
The PEM format is the most common format that Certificate Authorities issue certificates in. PEM certificates usually have extentions such as .pem, .crt, .cer, and .key. They are Base64 encoded ASCII files and contain "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" statements. Server certificates, intermediate certificates, and private keys can all be put into the PEM format.

OpenSSL is an open-source command line tool that is commonly used to generate private keys, create CSRs, install your SSL/TLS certificate, and identify certificate information.
